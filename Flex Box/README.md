# Flexbox Layout Demo

This project demonstrates the usage of CSS Flexbox properties to align and position elements in different ways.

## Concepts Practiced
- display: flex  
- flex-wrap  
- justify-content  
  - flex-start  
  - center  
  - flex-end  
  - space-around  
  - space-between  
  - space-evenly  
- align-items  
  - center  
  - flex-end  

## Description
Multiple containers are created to show how child elements behave with different `justify-content` and `align-items` values.  
Each box contains three elements aligned differently to visualize Flexbox behavior.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3  

## Purpose
This project was built as part of my frontend practice to understand Flexbox layout techniques.
