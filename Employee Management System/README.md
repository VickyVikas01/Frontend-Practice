Since you’ve now moved from single files to a multi-page website structure, this README.md should focus on navigation, consistent UI, and interlinking.

Employee Management System (Frontend Navigation)
This project is a multi-page web application practice focused on creating a cohesive user experience through consistent navigation and internal linking. It simulates the frontend of an Employee Management System.

🚀 Key Features
Persistent Navigation Bar: A consistent <nav> component across all pages using CSS Flexbox for alignment.

Multi-Page Architecture: Features five distinct interconnected pages: Home, About, Contact, Login, and Register.

Interactive Forms: * Login: A simple interface for existing employees to access the system.

Registration: A detailed form capturing employee data including name, email, gender (radio buttons), and address.

Responsive Layout: The navigation bar uses flex-wrap and justify-content: space-around to maintain structure on different screen sizes.

📂 Page Breakdown
Home (Home.html): The landing page with a welcoming heading for the management system.

About (About.html): Provides context for the system, mentioning the intended backend stack like Spring Boot.

Contact (Contact.html): A dedicated section for company contact information, including mobile and email placeholders.

Login (Login.html): Contains a targeted form for user authentication.

Register (Register.html): A comprehensive form for onboarding new employees into the database.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5: Used for semantic structure (<nav>, <section>, <label>) and form elements.

CSS3: Internal styling for the navigation flexbox and inline styling for specific text alignments and colors.

📝 Learning Objectives
Mastering the use of relative file paths (e.g., <a href="Login.html">) to link internal documents.

Ensuring UI consistency by reusing CSS styles across multiple HTML files.

Structuring forms with proper labels and input types for better accessibility.
